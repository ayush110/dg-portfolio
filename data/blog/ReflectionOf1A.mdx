Before reading this, keep in mind that it is a journal entry. The writing will not be professional, and the structure of the content might not flow as well :) This is purely meant for me!

Its done, the first semester of systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo. A friend described it as a 4 month SHAD, and it couldn’t have been more accurate. The feeling is absolutely surreal. It’s probably the first time in my life where I had to work this much with constant pressure. It was pretty overwhelming because I was never used to constantly thinking about things to do. (I love my boredom) But this phase taught me a lot of things, and I thought I would reflect about it a little bit. PS. In no way is this meant to be advice for incoming university students...

Overall, I am happy with the program I chose - the courses are fun and time passes by pretty quickly while working. The strong community is definitely an added bonus - actually, there are pros and cons, but in general its a good thing.

Right off the bat, university life is a lot more exciting (or there’s a lot more things happening in university) and it is easy to feel FOMO and then end up surrounding yourself with people all the time. Don’t forget to give yourself some time to catch a break. It’s very needed even if you don’t think that it is.

## **Important Realizations**

- Everyone generally has the same capabilities, they are just good at different things
- Talk to EVERYONE without judgement...srsly keep an open mind
- Don’t lose yourself - be authentic and who you are, make sure to form and keep your habits
- Make an effort to know people (first two weeks everyone is super friendly and nice, it won’t be weird trust me)
- Make an effort to keep the relationships you _want_ - especially with friends before uni
- DONT WORRY ABOUT GRADES, only about learning (marks will follow)
- Everyone comes from a different place, please please do not compare yourself...I’ve been there and its toxic asf
  - focus on passing your courses, making friends, enjoying the first-year experience, and being proactive about the experience you want to gain (Talk to a lot of upper years to get an understanding of how everything works).
  - I made the mistake of going into my first interview not having a single clue about how these things work. Don’t be me.
  - How can you avoid comparison? You’re first coop doesn’t determine anything. I know it’s kind of inevitable and I’m still figuring this out, but as long as you enjoy the grind, it takes you’re mind off of what other people are achieving. And sooner or later, you will look back and be proud of what you’ve accomplished.
- Go to events. Don’t miss out on trips, parties just to get a better mark on an assignment. These are the memories that last forever. Just don’t fail lol - going to a party knowing that you can potentially fail an assignment doesn’t make the party fun...
- Learned to be more authentic (towards the very end of the semester)
  - highschool was acc very easy and I just didn’t have the motivation to go the extra mile (I blame the brainwashing that school did to me...didn’t have enough time to figure out the stuff that’s actually gonna be valuable) On top of that, not enough people in the school I went to were motivating me. All in all, I would say that the environment I was in slowed me down quite a bit.
  - Coming into uni, I was slapped with how frickin awesome everyone is, and naturally developed a comparison mindset. My childhood need to be better than everyone at everything didn’t help here at all.
  - It took a lot of time to just realize that I’m not the best at anything, and that’s ok because that in and of itself can be a superpower
  - Started being myself and pursuing the things that I _like_ to do.
  - Up until now, my self worth was being more “accomplished” than other people. I was always that smart guy. That mentality erode after a lot of introspection. I’m not the smartest, nor do I need to prove myself. I’m here to learn and am building myself up to make a positive dent on the world. Nothing else really matters.

## **What I am going to do differently in 1B**

- Eat properly
  - No more campus or cmh pizza’s & quesadillas (instead, get something else from the plaza)
  - Eat more fruits
- Get good sleep the nights before morning classes (monday, tuesdays and wednesdays)
- Attend more tutorials (srsly these are super valuable)
- Make an effort to get to know professors
- Study on campus a little more (room and cmh is kinda dull)
- Be more proactive than reactive
  - Waterloo environment is good in that even being reactive gets you far, but being proactive just helps you develop the life you want
- Take care of my health
  - Go to the gym at least twice per week or play a sport (intramural volleyball ftw)

This is a lot, and if I spend more time on it, I could probably think of a million other things to add to each list. But rather than getting into the nitty gritty, I’ll stop here and treat this as all of the major things I wanted to put down. (Major in this context is just whatever came to mind first).

An important thing to keep in mind - this journal entry only consists of all the things I was comfortable making public. There are a lot of other points that were very personal to me, and frankly there is no point displaying all of that.
